## Prompt

```
/sp.implement

Implementation Objective:
Implement Phase I of the “Evolution of Todo” project by generating a fully
functional in-memory Python CLI Todo application strictly from the approved
specs, plan, and task breakdown using Claude Code.

Implementation Rules (Strict):
- All code must be generated by Claude Code
- Manual code writing or editing is prohibited
- Do not deviate from the approved specs, plan, or tasks
- If behavior is unclear, pause and request spec refinement instead of guessing
- Implementation must follow clean code and separation of concerns

Scope to Implement:
- Python CLI application with in-memory storage
- Core features:
  - Add Task (title, description)
  - View Task List (with completion status)
  - Update Task (title and/or description)
  - Delete Task (by ID)
  - Mark Task as Complete / Incomplete

Technical Constraints:
- Language: Python 3.13+
- Runtime: UV
- Storage: In-memory only (no files, no DB)
- Interface: Command Line only
- OS Compatibility: WSL 2 (Ubuntu 22.04)

Implementation Order:
1. Create project structure under `/src`
2. Implement core task data model and in-memory store
3. Implement business logic for each feature
4. Implement CLI interaction and command routing
5. Integrate error handling and user feedback
6. Validate full CLI flow end-to-end

Code Quality Requirements:
- Clear separation between:
  - CLI layer (input/output)
  - Core todo logic
- Deterministic task ID generation
- Readable, minimal, maintainable code
- No unused functions or dead code
- Consistent naming conventions

Validation During Implementation:
- After each feature:
  - Verify functionality via CLI interaction
  - Match outputs against acceptance criteria
- Handle edge cases:
  - Empty task list
  - Invalid task IDs
  - Invalid or missing inputs

Required Outputs:
- Python source code under `/src`
- Working CLI application runnable via UV
- README.md with setup and run instructions
- CLAUDE.md documenting Claude Code usage rules
- Specs history updated to reflect implementation decisions
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented the complete in-memory CLI Todo application following the spec-driven approach. Created all required components: data models, in-memory storage, business logic service, CLI interface, and documentation. The application supports all five core features (add, view, update, delete, mark complete/incomplete) with proper error handling and user feedback. The implementation follows clean architecture with separation of concerns between CLI layer and core logic.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Fully functional CLI Todo app implemented per specs
- 🧪 Tests: Manual CLI testing performed to validate functionality
- 📁 Files: Created complete application with all required components
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for Phase II evolution to web app
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation follows all architectural decisions and constraints

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin Phase II with database integration
