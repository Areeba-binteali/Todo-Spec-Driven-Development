/sp.constitution

Project: Evolution of Todo – Phase I (In-Memory CLI Todo App)

Purpose:
Build a Python-based command-line Todo application using strict Spec-Driven Development.
This phase establishes the architectural foundation for future evolution into a full-stack,
AI-powered, cloud-native system.

Core Principles:
- Spec-First Development: No implementation without an approved spec
- AI-Native Workflow: Claude Code is the sole code generator
- Deterministic Behavior: Clear inputs, outputs, and state transitions
- Simplicity First: Minimal complexity, maximum clarity
- Evolvability: Design decisions must support later phases (DB, API, AI agents)

Development Rules:
- Manual coding is strictly prohibited
- All logic must be generated via Claude Code from refined specs
- Specs must be written in Markdown using Spec-Kit Plus conventions
- Iterate on specs until correct behavior is achieved
- No external storage (in-memory only)

Functional Scope (Phase I Only):
- Add Task
- Delete Task
- Update Task
- View Task List
- Mark Task as Complete

System Constraints:
- Language: Python
- Interface: Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Storage: In-memory data structures only
- Persistence: None (data resets on restart)
- No third-party databases or frameworks

Quality Standards:
- Predictable CLI commands and responses
- Clear error handling for invalid inputs
- Consistent task identifiers
- Readable and maintainable generated code
- Separation of concerns (CLI handling vs core logic)

Spec Requirements:
- Each feature must have its own spec section
- Specs must define:
  - Inputs
  - Outputs
  - State changes
  - Edge cases
- Acceptance criteria must be explicit and testable

Success Criteria:
- All five core features work correctly via CLI
- Application runs without errors
- All code is generated by Claude Code
- Specs fully explain system behavior
- Ready to evolve into Phase II (Full-Stack Web App)

Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope):
- Databases or file storage
- Web UI or APIs
- AI, NLP, or chatbot features
- Authentication or user management
- Real-time synchronization
- Mobile applications
- Third-party integrations
```

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution file at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` that defines the core principles, system constraints, and development workflow for the Evolution of Todo project. The constitution establishes the foundational rules for spec-first development, CLI interface requirements, test-first methodology, deterministic behavior, simplicity, and AI-native development practices.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established foundational governance document for the project
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md with project principles
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with feature specification
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully captures all core principles from the project requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin feature specification
