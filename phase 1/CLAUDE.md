# Claude Code Usage Rules for Todo CLI App

This project was developed using Claude Code following strict Spec-Driven Development principles.

## Development Methodology

- All code was generated by Claude Code from approved specifications
- No manual code editing was performed
- All implementation follows the approved spec, plan, and task breakdown
- Changes to functionality must go through spec refinement first

## Project Structure

- `specs/1-todo-cli-app/` - Contains all specification documents
  - `spec.md` - Feature specification with user stories and requirements
  - `plan.md` - Implementation plan and architecture
  - `research.md` - Technical research and decision documentation
  - `data-model.md` - Data model specification
  - `quickstart.md` - Quickstart guide
  - `tasks.md` - Task breakdown for implementation
  - `checklists/` - Quality checklists

- `src/todo_app/` - Source code following clean architecture
  - `core/` - Business logic and data models
  - `cli/` - Command-line interface implementation

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

1. **Specification**: Requirements are defined in `specs/` documents
2. **Planning**: Architecture and implementation approach planned in `plan.md`
3. **Task Breakdown**: Implementation tasks defined in `tasks.md`
4. **Generation**: Claude Code generates all implementation code from specs
5. **Validation**: Implementation verified against acceptance criteria

## Code Quality Principles

- Clean separation between CLI layer and core business logic
- Deterministic behavior with consistent task ID generation
- Readable, maintainable, and minimal code
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- In-memory storage that supports future persistence layers

## Extending the Application

To add new features or modify existing functionality:

1. Update the specification in `specs/1-todo-cli-app/spec.md`
2. Revise the plan in `plan.md` if needed
3. Update tasks in `tasks.md` if needed
4. Have Claude Code regenerate the affected code from the updated specs
5. Test the new functionality

## Architecture Decisions

- **Task ID Generation**: Incremental integers for simplicity and readability
- **Storage Strategy**: Dictionary-based in-memory storage for Phase I
- **CLI Interface**: Subcommand-based using argparse for standard CLI patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between CLI handling and business logic
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for invalid inputs/IDs

These decisions support the evolution to Phase II (database-backed web app) while meeting Phase I requirements.
